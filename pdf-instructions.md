To create the PDF version of your resume:

1. Install a LaTeX distribution like MiKTeX or TeX Live if you haven't already
2. Run the command: `pdflatex resume.tex`
3. The generated PDF will be placed in the same directory

Once you have the PDF, place it in this repository so that the download button on your website works correctly.
